Scripts that do things with your clipboard

# How to Use

1. Copy something (perhaps by pipping to `pbcopy` first?)
2. Run one of these scripts
3. Profit!

# Alfred Workflow

While these scripts function by themselves (a deliberate intention), they are made to work with my [Alfred Actions Workflow](https://github.com/EvanLovely/alfred--actions) that allows you to copy stuff several ways, then immediately shows you a list of all these scripts and makes it easy to execute them.

# Contributing

Please do! Fork the repo and send pull requests my way! Please make sure the first line of the file is a comment that tells what it does (shows up in Alfred).
